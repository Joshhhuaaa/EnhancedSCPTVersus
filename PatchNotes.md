# Enhanced SCPT Versus Patch Notes

### Gameplay
- Spies will no longer faintly appear in EMF vision, often called EMF ghosting, when not using any equipment.
- Spies will no longer have adrenaline when being damaged allowing them to move faster for a short period. This eliminates major lag when Spies get shot at off-host.
- Bug fixed: Spies no longer have inconsistent damage values depending on which side of the body was hit.

### Audio
- The following sounds are no longer audible for more stealthy gameplay:
  - Using medical kits
  - Equipping the Shocker Gun without laser
  - Spies' goggles when switching vision modes
  - Crouched or sneaking footsteps
  - Soft landings on standard surfaces
  - Ledge climbing / shimmy
  - Pole / Ladder climbing
  - Back to wall animation

### Miscellaneous
- Includes the latest version of the game alongside the Unreal Level Editor pre-installed.
